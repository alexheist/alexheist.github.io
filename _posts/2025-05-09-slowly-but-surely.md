title: "slowly but surely"
---
i'm starting to feel better about the place technology has in my life. using email and voice messages more and more to reduce the stress of keeping up with the many people i'm lucky to have in my life. wasting away on the anti-social media less and less; though there's still room to improve. reading more. doing things i enjoy more. being more curious.

there's still a lot of habits i still want to change, but even just the past month has been noticeably more positive.
