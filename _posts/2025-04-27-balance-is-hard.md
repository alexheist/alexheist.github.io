title: "balance is hard"

the past week has felt particularly stressful. between work and caring for our very needy doggy, there's been a nearly constant need for me to handle whatever is demanding my attention and then recover to a more calm state. that's been the difficulty. what am i supposed to do to recover from a series of stressful situations?

lately, i've been turning to the easiest thing: passive scrolling on my phone. if not that, it's been going for a walk to cool off and then returning to my phone once i'm home. in a way, i feel like i've developed an emotional dependence on this device to provide a distraction, anything, from the recent stresses. reflecting on it, it's not great. though, at the same time, i feel some grace toward myself; it's ok to choose the easy option sometimes.

this week ahead i'm going to try to capture and savor the quiet moments i have to decompress differently. it's not like there is any shortage of things i want to spend more time on: pokemon, reading, meditation, chess, guitar, cooking, cleaning, writing, working on this website to name a few.
