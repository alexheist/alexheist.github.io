title: "enjoying the small moments"

grave injustice, instability, and flagrant disregard for truth or morality. much of the what is happening in the world right now is sick and it's sickness is infectious. stress. anxiety. overwhelm. it feels unavoidable, at least if you have a conscience. maintaining hope through everything is difficult, extremely difficult, but vitally important. these days, i find hope and beauty and love in many things; holding hands with my partner while we read or watch ozark; opening up to my friends when their names come up on my lock screen; meeting new and kind people playing chess at the library. 

yesterday, in the middle of the night, i woke from a dream in laughter because in that dream someone introduced themselves, as a bit, as Gloon Salanchez.

i still find it funny every time i think about it.
