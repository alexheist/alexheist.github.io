title: "relearning to be playful"

when i think back on my journey of figuring out how all this computer stuff works, i notice that a lot of my effort was spent trying to curate a persona that people would take _seriously_. it makes sense, my early career was chaotic to say the least. i had been finishing my associate program where i had learned the basics of programming but did not, as i was surprised to find out, transfer into a computer science program at the university i planned on attending for my bachelor's. i started work at a small code shop (and by small i mean that by the time i had left our staff had dwindled to just me and the owner) that was constantly having to justify it's value to existing and potential clients. i desperately wanted to 'graduate' to something that felt more stable but found only rejection until i completed by bachelor's and was recruited by my current company.

thinking about how i would like _this_ version of my website to look, i realized i had only ever developed the skills to design something that looked _professional_. implicit in my designs was my need to justify myself as being serious and worth employing.

now, i want something _fun_.

i've found inspiration in the personal websites that i've come across that _feel_ personal. i want my website to _feel_ personal. right now i'm just gathering inspiration and brainstorming different things i could try, but hopefully in the near-ish future i'll be able to publish something that is more a reflection of myself than my past need to be taken seriously.
