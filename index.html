hello world,

it's been a long time since i've reflected on my presence on the internet. this past
week, i've considered it a lot and found inspiration in the online presence of
others. people who maintain personal, yet public, websites. i'm drawn to that idea.
i'm drawn to using the internet and technology in the way that it has promised to
be as opposed to the way that it is provided to us. as a means to connect with
others despite geographic or temporal barriers. as a means to participate and engage
with ideas and stories that we come across. not as a means to be monetized for my
my attention. i'd rather my attention be elsewhere. with real people. some who i now
have the pleasure to know. others who i look forward to knowing when our paths
cross in a moment of serendipity. others still who i'll never know but who i'll have
connected with through this website and elsewhere my digital bubble can be found.

so, here's to the start of that new beginning.
