<p>enjoying the small moments</p>
<p>grave injustice, instability, and flagrant disregard for truth or morality. much of
the what is happening in the world right now is sick and it's sickness is infectious.
stress. anxiety. overwhelm. it feels unavoidable, at least if you have a conscience.
maintaining hope through everything is difficult, extremely difficult, but vitally
important. these days, i find hope and beauty and love in many things; holding hands
with my partner while we read or watch ozark; opening up to my friends when their names
come up on my lock screen; meeting new and kind people playing chess at the library.</p>
<p>yesterday, in the middle of the night, i woke from a dream in laughter because in
that dream, someone introduced themselves, as a bit, as Gloot Salanchez. i still find it
funny every time i think about it.</p>

<p>nostalgia & grief</p>
<p>lately i've been experiencing quite a bit of inner turmoil. this project, my turn
toward my personal website as a digital refuge is an expression of that turmoil. though
it feels imprecise, the word 'alienated' has echoed in my mind, my body, my spirit when
i think about my current relationship with the world. 'if only i could turn back the
clock to when things made more sense'; when i used the home phone to call friends and
family; or even when i still left voicemails; when i used email to have conversations
with classmates after we both went home. something has changed within me. it feels
ridiculous to be twenty seven and thinking the world's changed in a way i don't
understand and in a way that scares me. i thought that feeling was reserved for folks
like sheriff bell in no country for old men. maybe things are just moving faster now;
that the modern rate of change is aging and alienating younger and younger folks who,
like me, might wake up one day and buy an old gameboy to soothe the tension they feel.
to reconnect with something they can understand.</p>

<p>hello world,</p>
<p>it's been a long time since i've reflected on my presence on the internet. this past
week, i've considered it a lot and found inspiration in the online presence of
others. people who maintain personal, yet public, websites. i'm drawn to that idea.
i'm drawn to using the internet and technology in the way that it has promised to
be as opposed to the way that it is provided to us. as a means to connect with
others despite geographic or temporal barriers. as a means to participate and engage
with ideas and stories that we come across. not as a means to be monetized for my
my attention. i'd rather my attention be elsewhere. with real people. some who i now
have the pleasure to know. others who i look forward to knowing when our paths
cross in a moment of serendipity. others still who i'll never know but who i'll have
connected with through this website and elsewhere my digital bubble can be found.</p>
<p>so, here's to the start of that new beginning.</p>
